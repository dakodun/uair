	Uair Engine - A simple C++ game engine
--
	I wrote this engine as a learning exercise, but also sought it to be highly useable, adaptable and
	upto date (in terms of technology). The engine has gone through a lot of variations, including ports
	to and then back from other languages (such as HTML5 and JS).
	

	This is some basic documentation of the various parts of the engine including a quick getting started
	guide and basic usage examples.
	
	
	The Uair Engine is released under the [link:zlib license|http://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html].
